# autoDistribution_for_earthWorks
This is a demo for automatic distribution of earthworks in airport construction management using the simplex method. The implementation also includes Bland's rule to prevent cycling during iterations (I did encounter this rare situation during testing).
The data in the repo is from a real-world example of a sea airdrome.
Please note that in some cases, the method could potentially result in unbounded solutions or numerical instability. I will attempt to address these issues in future updates.
